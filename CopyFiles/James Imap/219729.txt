At the moment the CapatibilityProcessor need to get a List of Strings (one String per Capability) passed to the constructor. This is not really elegant. It would be more elegant to have a a new interface which Processors need to implement if they implement a Capability and register these on the CapabilityProcessor. This would make it even easier to add new Capabilites later without messing the the &quot;core&quot; code

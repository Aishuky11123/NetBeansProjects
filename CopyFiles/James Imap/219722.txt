The method MailboxMapper.countMailboxesWithName(mailboxName) is\\only ever used in StoreMailboxManager.mailboxExists(mailboxName\,\\session). There the result is checked for duplicates. Duplicates should\\be detected before writing and not when reading\, for some stores (e.g.\\maildir) it is not even possible to have more than one mailbox with the\\same name. So this is superfluous and should should be moved to\\MailboxMapper.existsMailbox(mailboxName) which can provide a more\\efficient existence test.

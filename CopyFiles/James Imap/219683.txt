At the moment the Mailbox interface offer the method :\\\\long appendMessage(byte[] message\, Date internalDate\, MailboxSession mailboxSession\, \\boolean isRecent\, Flags flags) throws MailboxException;\\\\This is not really efficient because for using this you need to load the whole message content into memory. It would be better to use an InputStream. So it would look like:\\\\\\long appendMessage(InputStream in\, Date internalDate\, MailboxSession mailboxSession\, \\boolean isRecent\, Flags flags) throws MailboxException;\\\\This would allow us to stream the message directly without have it in memory. If you really want to store a message which is hold in memory\, you could use an ByteArrayInputStream for this.
